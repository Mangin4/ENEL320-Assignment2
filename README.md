![Question 1](/Images/Q1.png)

<h3> a) </h3>
<p>The image below shows the signal and its fourier transform. The siganl is made up of the following functions. 

        x = 30*sin(2*np.pi*5*t)
        x = 50*sin(2*np.pi*20*t)
        x = 10*sin(2*np.pi*30*t)</p>

<p>The following image shows the same signal but the fourier transform only shows one period of. This was done by only useing half of the values that come out of the DFT </p>
